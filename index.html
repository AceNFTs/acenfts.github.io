    <h2>About the Art</h2>
    <p>
      Every piece begins with a photograph.<br>
      <strong>Real. Raw. Unfiltered.</strong><br>
      Captured truths emerge with hand-drawn sketches, each stroke instinctive and irreproducible. 
      The result is a dialogue between clarity and chaos, between the precision of the lens and the emotion of the hand. 
      These compositions are not merely images; they are experiences etched in light and line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three signature layers of each piece:<br>
      <em>First Layer:</em> Created by Camera. Original, Pure Photograph.<br>
      <em>Second Layer:</em> Created by Hand. Elevating fragments with bold, rough, and expressive sketches that interrupt and engage the clarity of the picture.<br>
      <em>Third Layer:</em> Artist Signature to Authenticate the Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      This tension between control and instinct, structure and abstraction defines the signature aesthetic of the work.  
      Each creation is distinctive, not only in form but equally in philosophy. 
      These are not digital reproductions or generative imitations; they are handcrafted masterpieces.  
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- About the Artist Section -->
  <section id="about-artist">
    <h2>About the Artist</h2>
    <p>
      Ace is a visual artist whose work exists at the intersection of precision and instinct, tradition and innovation.  
      Each artwork begins with the lens — a carefully composed photograph that reflects the artist’s trained eye for natural balance, contrast, and mood. 
      What follows is a spontaneous, analog intervention: hand-drawn sketches layered over the image in a raw, gestural style. 
      This dual-medium approach infuses each work with texture, vulnerability, and intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a background in professional photography and a deep sensitivity to form and emotion, Ace creates pieces that push the boundaries of digital art while remaining rooted in physical craft.  
      The artist's philosophy is centered on authenticity in an age of automation. Nothing is auto-generated. No shortcuts are taken.  
      Every NFT is minted a single time and will never be reproduced. All of Ace's artworks are captured by eye, created by hand, and sealed by code — each one a signature moment in time, committed to the blockchain with finality.
    </p>

  <!-- For NFT Investors Section -->
  <section id="for-investors">
    <h2>For NFT Investors</h2>
    <p>
      These artworks are not just visually impactful — they also offer a rare convergence of artistic integrity and technological authenticity.  
      Each NFT represents a one-of-one asset, combining two distinct layers of value:  
      <strong>Foundational Photography</strong>, professionally captured, compositionally sound, and embedded with provenance through the original image data.  
      And <strong>Hand-Drawn Intervention</strong>, an irreplaceable layer of artistic authorship, created manually over the original photograph, and digitized without the use of AI or filters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The human presence in each work is unmistakable. Every line, smudge, and deviation is intentional, unrepeatable, and legally protected by the NFT’s smart contract.  
      As blockchain-based assets, these pieces are resistant to duplication, fraud, and degradation, yet they retain the tactile immediacy of fine art.
    </p>
    <p>
      For collectors and investors seeking assets that combine scarcity, originality, and conceptual depth, this body of work offers more than a token — it offers enduring artistic value.  
      In a saturated market, true uniqueness stands out. These NFTs are not part of a series or algorithm; they are standalone works with a pure, human vision.
